## impossible question with the prototype

Use the same image multiple times on the layout? what should we do about it? the way we set up the data makes it impossible as we use strapi link.
How can we do that?

how to manage the css?

the css we wanna save is a bunch of data that belong to the sequence. 


THE ROAD FOR THE STYLES
create style sheet when there is a new sequence
put the sequence in a style element, 
add css rules for each move/resize
push the css rules to the cssOM stylesheet.
save that style sheet. 


THE STYLESHEET AND FIX LA TAILLE
Clean the css rules once in a while.

on duplicate plan, duplicate the css rules?
or assume tht they’ll move around
